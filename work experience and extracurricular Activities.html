          <h1 class="with-project-number"><span class="project-number">01</span>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
          <p>As a student in his third year I lead a very active life. I have done a lot of volunteering, at animal shelters and in a lot of organizations. but currently, I am volunteering at the renowned Enactus ASU. Enactus is one of the most successful organizations in the world and it has given back a lot to communities across the world, and I am proud to call myself an Enactus member. in Enactus I have been through a lot and actually accomplished a lot as a member, I was appointed as a team leader several times, and I’ve been commended a lot by my peers for my leadership skills. I also helped in creating events for the organization and participated in a lot of them. we have had a lot of events, most of them aimed towards making our society better. I was also a content writer for the organization, I helped with the creation of the content that we would post on the organization’s page. overall Enactus has provided me with tons of experience, that will surely carry on to any organization that I work in.  </p>

             <h1 class="with-project-number"><span class="project-number">02</span>Work experience</h1>
            <p>My first working experience was in Akila cosmetics, Akila is a startup company that deals with cosmetics and natural beauty free from chemicals. my job role was to manage a team of five individuals and to write content and advertisement for the company. I helped the company through its launching phase and gladly we had a lot of sales and the company was a success. Akila gave me a lot of experience and helped me solidify my management skills as well as marketing and sales skills.</p>

            <h1 class="with-project-number"><span class="project-number">03</span>Summary</h1>
              <p>To sum up my experience I like to think I have a lot of hands-on experience, I’ve had my fair share of obstacles that faced me throughout my experiences but gladly I emerged victorious in the end. I have a lot of knowledge in my field of study as well as many other fields because knowing and understanding more is the key to unlocking more of this mysteriously mystifying world we live in. if you're an organization that wishes to hire me, I promise nothing but efficiency and dedication to your organization. and I truly promise amazing results. if you're just a passer-by, then I hope this brief bio and information gave you a glimpse about me and thanks for taking the time of your day to read this.
